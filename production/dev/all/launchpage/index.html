                <center><h2>The Problem:</h2></center>
                <b>I've just built this great PostgreSQL database. How do I get it to my users?</b>
                <br /><br />
                A full time developer might build a web application. But web applications are complex. Many frameworks and programming languages exist to make web applications possible but none of them make creating a web application easy.
                <br /><br />
                Typically, writing a web application involves learning a programming language for building the server. Which means you need to learn about all the ways a webpage can talk to a server and make sure that you don't introduce security problems. Sometimes there are performance issues or new requirements that could lead to a re-write. 
                <br /><br />
                But that's just the server side. Then you've got to write the client. HTML, CSS and what if we need more than just a static web page? There are many Javascript frameworks out there to help because javascript is complex. 
                <br /><br />
                Overall, modern web development isn't easy for a database administrator. 
                <br /><br />
                <center><h2>The Solution:</h2></center>
                A server program that exposes a database to the local network or even the internet. This server will also provide a complete API so that you dont need to learn server programming at all. Just set it up and get to work on the web application.
                Also, a UI with HTML tags that implement standard functionality for database applications, like <b>&#60;my-header&#62;</b> or <b>&#60;my-combobox&#62;</b> or <b>&#60;my-table&#62;</b>.
                
                <!--
                <b>I want a server that exposes my database to the local network or even the internet. It would provide a complete API that meant I didn't need to learn server programming at all. Just let me set it up and get to work on my web application.
                Then, I want HTML tags that do what I want, like &#60;my-header&#62; or &#60;my-combobox&#62; or &#60;my-table&#62;.</b>
                -->
                
                <br /><br />
                <center><h2>Introducing: Envelope Server</h2></center>
                Envelope Server is a complete web app platform that makes building database driven web apps easy. <b>All you need to know is SQL, some HTML and basic Javascript</b>. With this basic knowledge you can build a real database application fast! 
                <br /><br />
                Download the Envelope Server and configure it to point at your database cluster. Now you've now got an engine that exposes your database using a fixed API. <b>Security is handled by PostgreSQL</b> so your users log in to Envelope using their PostgreSQL user name and password. From there all requests and server security is handled by Envelope Server using encrypted cookies. All database security is handled by GROUPs and ROLEs in PostgreSQL.
                <br /><br />
                But what about the HTML? Until recently, we were stuck with the HTML that browser vendors granted us. <a href="http://webcomponents.org/" target="_blank">Web Components</a> and <a href="http://www.x-tags.org/" target="_blank">X-Tags</a> have changed all that. Envelope Server comes with a library of new HTML tags that make building a web app easy. Ever wonder when browser vendors were going to give us a great combo box? Don't wait any longer! Envelope Server comes with all the HTML tags you've been missing, and that makes your HTML a lot easier to read, write and debug. Have a look at an example with attributes removed:

                That's <b>a lot easier to read</b> than your typical web app! Check out the documentation for a complete list of tags and their attributes. There are lots of examples and sample code that you can play with. All our HTML components are mobile aware and make it easy to have your application look good whether its on a phone or on a desktop.
