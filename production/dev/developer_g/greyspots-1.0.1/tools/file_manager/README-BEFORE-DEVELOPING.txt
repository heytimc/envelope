You may have noticed that in the file_manager folder there is a backup folder, let me tell you what it's for. The backup folder is for when you break the file editor or manager and you need a stable version to reverse the changes or to fix it. It has its own copy of greyspots JS and CSS so that if you break those it's still safe. It does not have it's own copy of the Ace editor so if you are going to do stuff to ace please save a copy so that you can immediatly restore it to a working version.

If you run into an issue where you need to use the backup simply add "/backup" after "developer_g/file_manager" in the URL. In fact while you are reading this why don't you give it a try just to make sure it is still in working order. If it isn't working but the regular version is working please refresh the backup, it's supposed to be dependable.

If you make some big changes and everything thing is working nice: refresh the backup so that the backup doesn't get so old it doesn't work.



If you have any questions: get ahold of Michael, say something nice (e.g. "what a nice pallor you've developed"), then ask away.
